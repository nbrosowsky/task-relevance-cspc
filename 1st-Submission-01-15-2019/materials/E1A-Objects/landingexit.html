		<h2>Task Overview</h2>
		<hr>
		<p><strong>Time:</strong> This task takes approximately 15 to 25 minutes. There are 314 trials. </p>
		<p><strong>Compensation:</strong> You will be compensated $2.00 for completing the hit.</p>
		<p><strong>Task:</strong> Indicate whether a center arrow is pointed left or right while counting images.</p>
		<p><strong>Preview:</strong> You can preview this hit by continuing without accepting the hit. </p>
		<p class="spaceAbove"><em>*To complete the hit you must accept the hit before continuing.</em></p>
		<p>If you are in preview mode: close the window, then accept the hit on the main window to continue.</p>
		<p class="spaceAbove"><em>**Please Note: This experiment requires a pop-window to be full-screen.</em> </p>
		<p>At the end of the experiment the window will automatically close and return you to amazon where you can submit the hit.</p>

		<h2 class="spaceAbove"><strong>Task Instructions</strong></h2>
		<p class="spaceBelow"><em>Note: These instructions will be repeated again before you begin the experiment.</em></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>On each trial you will be presented with five arrows pointed left or right paired with an image.</p>
		<p class="spaceAbove"><strong>For example: </strong> </p>
		<div class="examples" display="center">
			<div class="examples" style="border: solid; padding: 40px 100px 10px 100px">

		<h3>
				You will have two tasks:
		</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
					<li>Your first task is to indicate whether the <strong><em>center arrow</em></strong> is pointed left or right. </li>
					<li>You will use the keyboard to respond: Press "Z" if the arrow is pointed left or press "M", if the arrow is pointed right.</li>
					<li>Please respond as quickly and as accurately as possible</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
			</li>
			<li>
				<ul style="list-style-type:none">
					<li>Your second task will be to keep count of a certain type of image.</li>
					<li>For example, you could be asked to keep count of how many trials include a blue item.</li>
					<li>Periodically throughout the experiment, you will be asked to report how many you have counted up to that point, and to restart your count from zero.</li>

			<h2><strong>Title:</strong> Cognitive processes in motor control</h2>
			<h2><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Dr. Matthew Crump - Psychology Department</h2>
			<hr>

			<h3>Purpose of the Research Study:</h3>
			<p>The research is being conducted to gain more knowledge about the cognitive processes involved in highly trained skills, such as typing, that require people to rapidly order actions in a goal-directed fashion.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Procedures:</h3>
			<p>The experiment will involve one session lasting approximately 15-25 minutes. The specific task may vary and could involved the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Perform typing tasks. Tasks involve being presented with a visual stimulus and making a typing response. The visual stimulus could be a word, a letter, a string of letters, or a picture. You will be required to make a response to the target by using
					the computer keyboard. Unless instructed otherwise please be as quick and accurate as possible when making responses.</li>
			</ol>

			<p style="font-size: 14"><em><strong>*Note that sometimes the backspace or delete key may not function during the task.</em></strong>
			</p>
			<p style="font-size: 14"><em><strong>**This task is only for people who are fluent in English.</em></strong>
			</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Risks/Discomforts:</h3>
			<p>There are no risks for participating in this study beyond those associated with normal computer use.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Benefits:</h3>
			<p>Although it will not directly benefit you, this study will advance basic science on the cognitive processes involved in motor control. This could lead to better training curriculum for improving skills like typing and playing musical instruments.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Voluntary participation and right to withdraw:</h3>
			<p> Participation in this study is voluntary, and you can stop at any time without penalty. To stop, click on the "Return HIT" button, or close your browser window.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Confidentiality:</h3>
			<p>The only identifying information kept based on your participation in this study will be your Amazon Mechanical Turk WorkerID serial number. This is automatically recorded.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Compensation:</h3>
			<p>If you satisfactorily complete the study, you will receive $2.00. Payments are made via Amazon's payment system.</p>
			<hr>

			<h3>Questions or Concerns:</h3>
			<p>You can ask questions about this research study now or any time during the study by e-mailing Nick Brosowsky at

			<h3>Thank you for participating in our experiment! </h3>
			<p class="spaceBelow">This document serves as short description of the purposes behind our experiment.</p>
			<p class="spaceBelow">
				The general purpose of this study is to investigate spatial aspects of human attention.
			</p>
			<p>
				You just completed what is commonly known as a Flanker task. On each trial you were presented with five arrows pointed left or right. Sometimes the center arrow was pointed in the same direction as the other four, and sometimes it was pointed in the opposite
				direction. Typically people are slower to respond when the center arrow is pointed in the opposite direction. This is thought to reflect your ability to ignore conflicting information (the slower you are, the harder it is to ignore the other arrows).
			</p>
			<p class="spaceAbove">
				The current experiment investigated whether people can learn about image features associated with more or less conflicting information (e.g., the color blue, the hat image, etc.). For example, if you learn that blue items are generally associated with
				conflict, you might be able to use that as a cue for more focused attention. The counting task was used to get you to focus on certain features more than others.
			</p>
